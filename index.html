   	<h1>Hello, Welcome to my Website</h1>
    <p>This is the first paragraph from a short story I wrote in eighth grade called<font color="blue"><b>'The Imaginative Mind of Bella Jones'.</b></font></p> 
  
  <p>In the small town of Bovey Tracey the sun rarely shines and the sky is always grey. Nine year old Bella was walking around her house looking for her mom. They had recently moved and her parents were not paying her much attention. Her mom, Viktoria, was a chef and was preoccupied trying to reopen her restaurant. Her dad, however, was never really home that much. Bella wished that she and her parents got along, but that was not the case. “Mom! Dad!” Bella shouted knowing very well neither of them would answer. She ran up the stairs which creaked every step she took. She crept into her dad’s study. There was a pile of stacked papers, but no dad. She ran to her mom’s room worried they had forgotten she was there and left. She felt like a ghost in her own home.</p>
